                To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
                whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
                the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
                or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and
                 by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; no 
                 more; and, by a sleep to say we end the 
                 heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks 
                 that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation 
                 devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to 
                 sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the
